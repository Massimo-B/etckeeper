Hi;

I'm implementing etckeeper for all of our servers, but I'm concerned about the "unlimited growth potential" of the /etc/.git repository.  (Note: I'm not a git expert by any means.)

Google hasn't explicitly said so, but there are hints that rebasing (followed by garbage collection) will let me squash commits and keep the repository from filling up the root partition.

The command `git log --before 'two weeks ago' -1` shows the last commit made just before that point in time, so that may be useful in the final solution. 

Also, [[this post|Prevent_hook_running_during_rebase]] briefly describes the correct process for rebasing: `clone /etc repo, edit, and force pull the changes`

So, in a nutshell: 

* How can I squash all commits older than (say) two weeks into a single commit at the root of the /etc repo, leaving younger commits alone?
  - This should nuke all the copies of things that were deleted from /etc more than two weeks ago, yes?

* If I wanted to emulate monthly, weekly and daily backups (with different retention periods) in the etckeeper repository, how could it be done?

Thanks!
