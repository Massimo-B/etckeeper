I get this warning:

etckeeper warning: hardlinked files could cause problems with git:
PackageKit/events/post-transaction.d/README
PackageKit/events/pre-transaction.d/README

What kind of problems can happen?

In my use case it is no problem if the hardlink gets lost and two individual files
are in the repo.
