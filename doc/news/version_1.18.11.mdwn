   * Support platforms without a hostname command, fall back to
     reading /etc/hostname.
     Thanks, Chris Morgan
   * commit: Support -mmessage, without a space, since eg git commit
     can be used that way.
     Thanks, martin f. krafft
   * commit: When multiple parameters are given, use them all as the commit
     message, instead of the old behavior of only using the first parameter and
     throwing the rest away.
     Thanks, martin f. krafft"""]]
