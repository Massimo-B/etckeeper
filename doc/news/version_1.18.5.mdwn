   * Make etckeeper commit store metadata changes. The pre-commit
     hook has always (and continues) to do that, but pre-commit is only
     run when there are changes to tommit. This makes metadata-only
     changes get committed.
   * Move systemd files to /lib/systemd; /usr/lib/systemd is not used
     on Debian."""]]
