   * Work around git commit's lack of robustness, by providing
     reasonable default values for GIT\_COMMITTER\_EMAIL etc.
     This was already done as part of the su/sudo handling,
     and is now always done.
   * Don't hardcode the master branch when pushing to PUSH\_REMOTE.
     Instead, let git push whatever branches it is configured to
     push to that remote."""]]
