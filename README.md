# etckeeper

Project page: https://etckeeper.branchable.com/

Forked from https://git.joeyh.name/git/etckeeper.git in order to add the following features:

* Being able to track /
* Being able to track only specific files using a * ignore: With the original version it's possible to ignore * but every commit still tries to scan all the / tree.

My proposals and questions like https://etckeeper.branchable.com/todo/Adding_support_for_.hgignore/ from years ago have always been ignored.
